The course will provide an opportunity to synthesize and apply the knowledge and analytical skills learned, to be developed as a prototype or simulation. The project extends to 2 semesters and will be evaluated in the 7th and 8th semester separately, based on the achieved objectives. One third of the project credits shall be completed in 7th semester and two third in 8th semester. It is recommended that the projects may be finalized in the thrust areas of the respective engineering stream or as interdisciplinary projects. Importance should be given to address societal problems and developing indigenous technologies. ii. COURSE OVERVIEW The aim of this course is to apply engineering knowledge in solving practical problems, to foster innovation in design of products, processes or systems, and to develop creative thinking in finding viable solutions to engineering problems. iii. COURSE OUTCOMES After successful completion of the course, the students will be able to: Model and solve real world problems by applying knowledge CO1 Apply across domains Develop products, processes or technologies for sustainable and CO2 Apply socially relevant applications Function effectively as an individual and as a leader in diverse CO3 Apply teams and to comprehend and execute designated tasks Plan and execute tasks utilizing available resources within timelines, CO4 Apply following ethical and professional norms Identify technology/research gaps and propos innovative/creative CO5 Analyze solutions Organize and communicate technical and scientific findings CO6 Apply effectively in written and oral forms iv. Phase 2 TARGETS: • In depth study of the topic assigned in the light of the report prepared under Phase - I; • Review and finalization of the approach to the problem relating to the assigned topic. • Preparing a detailed action plan for conducting the investigation, including teamwork. • Detailed Analysis/ Modeling / Simulation/ Design/ Problem Solving/Experiment as needed. • Final development of product/ process, testing, results, conclusions and future directions. • Preparing a paper for Conference Presentation/ Publication in Journals, if possible. • Presenting projects in Project Expos conducted by the University at the cluster level and/ or state level as well as others conducted in India and abroad. • Filing Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) if applicable. 324

Course Year of Course Name Category L T P Credit Code Introduction CS1U42A DEEP LEARNING PEC 2 1 0 3 2020 i. PRE-REQUISITE: Nil ii. COURSE OVERVIEW Deep Learning is the recently emerged branch of machine learning, particularly designed to solve a wide range of problems in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. In this course, the building blocks used in deep learning are introduced. Specifically, neural networks, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Learning and optimization strategies such as Gradient Descent, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent, Adam, AdaGrad and RMSProp are also discussed in this course. This course will help the students to attain sound knowledge of deep architectures used for solving various Vision and NLP tasks.
