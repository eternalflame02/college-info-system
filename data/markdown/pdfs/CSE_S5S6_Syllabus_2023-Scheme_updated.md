Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology Year:2023/Version 2.0 iv. SYLLABUS Introduction to data science, beginning with the typology of problems and the foundational importance of linear algebra, statistics, and optimization. It emphasizes structured thinking in solving both structured and unstructured data problems. Core statistical concepts such as descriptive statistics, statistical features, outlier analysis, data summarization, and various forms of distribution and plotting are covered, along with advanced topics like dimensionality reduction, sampling techniques, Bayesian statistics, and statistical modeling. The Python programming component includes basics like variables, data types, control structures, string operations, and core data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and regular expressions. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is explored in depth, covering its motivation, steps, basic tools, data types, and the data analytics lifecycle. The syllabus also covers data acquisition, pre-processing, quality transformation, and text data handling. Students are introduced to principles of data visualization, including workflows, abstraction techniques, task validation, and a variety of chart types. The course concludes with hands-on exposure to open-source tools such as R, Octave, Scilab, and Python libraries like SciPy, scikit-learn, PyBrain, Pylearn2, and Weka for real-world data science applications. v(a)TEXTBOOKS 1.

Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology Year:2023/Version 2.0 iii. GENERAL GUIDELINES Student groups consisting of three to four members are required to select a topic of interest in consultation with their Project Supervisor. They should conduct a thorough literature review and identify a problem to address the gaps identified, related to the chosen topic. Clear objectives must be defined, and a suitable methodology should be developed to achieve them. The project should incorporate innovative design concepts, while considering important factors such as performance, scalability, reliability, aesthetics, ergonomics, user experience, and security. The progress of the mini project is evaluated based on three reviews. The first review is to check the feasibility in implementation of the project. The second review is to evaluate the progress of the work. The third review will evaluate the completed work. The review committee will be constituted by the Head of the Department comprising of HoD or a senior faculty member, Mini Project coordinator and project supervisor. The evaluation shall be made based on the progress/outcome of the project, reports and a viva-voce examination, conducted internally by the review committee. A project report is required at the end of the semester. The project has to be demonstrated for its full design specifications. iv. EVALUATION PATTERN Total Marks CIE Marks ESE Marks 100 60 40 v.

COURSE OVERVIEW This is a theoretical course in computer science to enable the learners to know the fundamentals of computability and complexity theories. It covers the notions of computability/decidability, the process of reduction to prove decidability/undecidability and the classification of problems into class P, class NP and class NP Complete based on the time complexity of solving the problems. This course helps the learner to identify whether a real life problem is decidable/undecidable and also to classify a decidable problem into tractable or intractable, based on the time complexity class it belongs. iii.
