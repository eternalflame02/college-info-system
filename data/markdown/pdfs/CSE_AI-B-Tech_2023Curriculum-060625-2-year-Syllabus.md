COURSE OVERVIEW The Database Management Systems course is intended to impart the elementary concepts of a database management system to students and equip them to design and implement a database application based on those concepts. This course helps the learners to get practical exposure on database creation, SQL queries creation, transaction processing and NoSQL & MongoDB based operations. The course enables the students to create, manage and administer the databases, develop necessary tools for the design and development of the databases, and to understand emerging technologies to handle Big Data. ii. COURSE OUTCOMES After the completion of the course the student will be able to Course Description Level Outcomes CO1 Design database schema for a given real world problem-domain Apply using standard design and modeling approaches. CO2 Construct queries using SQL for database creation, interaction, Apply modification, and updation. C03 Design and implement triggers and cursors.
