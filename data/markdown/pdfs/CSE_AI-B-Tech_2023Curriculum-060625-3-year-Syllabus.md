B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering-AI 2023-24 iii. GENERAL GUIDELINES Student groups consisting of three to four members are required to select a topic of interest in consultation with their Project Supervisor. They should conduct a thorough literature review and identify a problem to address the gaps identified, related to the chosen topic. Clear objectives must be defined, and a suitable methodology should be developed to achieve them. The project should incorporate innovative design concepts, while considering important factors such as performance, scalability, reliability, aesthetics, ergonomics, user experience, and security. The progress of the mini project is evaluated based on three reviews. The first review is to check the feasibility in implementation of the project. The second review is to evaluate the progress of the work. The third review will evaluate the completed work. The review committee will be constituted by the Head of the Department comprising of HoD or a senior faculty member, Mini Project coordinator and project supervisor. The evaluation shall be made based on the progress/outcome of the project, reports and a viva-voce examination, conducted internally by the review committee. A project report is required at the end of the semester. The project has to be demonstrated for its full design specifications. iv. EVALUATION PATTERN Total Marks CIE Marks ESE Marks 100 60 40 v.
