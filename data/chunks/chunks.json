The students were divided into groups of two to six and sent to various study centers, mostly houses and in some cases anganvadis (primary level schools). Each student carried a laptop to illustrate the basics of computer systems. Additional desktop computers were also carried as part of our plan to accustom them with its usage and its difference with that of a standard laptop system. Since two days are not enough to teach the vast ocean of information related to computers, the plan is to organize several such events in the future to develop and inculcate the usage of computers in today’s ever growing world of computerization. The NSS (National Service Scheme) wing of our college played a major part in giving us such a wonderful opportunity to perform an invaluable duty to our society. The Pallichal panchayath supported the initiative to a great extent by not only arranging for vehicles to transport the students to the various centers but also with food and refreshments for the participants.",

    "text": "## TEDxMBCET\n\nOn February 9, Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology in Nalanchira, saw it’s gates open to it’s first ever TEDx event. TEDxMBCET, an independently organized TED event, featuring 7 speakers from various walks of life. The theme for the day was ‘Observably Random’, a look into the fascinating world of chaos, randomness and the ever growing world of the trivial.\n\nThe inauguration of the event started at 10: 30 am with the ceremonial lamp being lit by Rev. Fr. Raju Parukoor, Asst. Bursar; Dr. T. M. George, Principal; Dr.Tessy Mathew, Head of Department and Devi VS, student coordinator and event licensee. The first talk of the day was by Arjun Hari, CEO of WudiDatatech Pvt Ltd. He shared some wise words with the attendees on the topic of career disillusionment and why it’s okay to not have a fixed career path in this modern age. Following up on Arjun, was the musician Akhil Vinay, whose life story resembles that of the great pianist, Ray Charles. Blinded at age of 9, Akhil Vinay passionately followed his love of music and still practices and teaches music today. Akhil’s talk was centred around his life and his experiences as he started going blind.\n\nNext up on the roster was the ever fantastic Nikhil Prasad, founder and creative head of Karriku Fresh, Kerala’s first exclusively digital media platform. He talked about his struggles starting the enterprise and inspired attendees to dream big dreams and never let them die. The fourth speaker of the day was the ever energetic, Nilja K Baby, Radio Jockey at Radio Mirchi Kochi. A person who uses her voice everyday to provide for herself, it was no surprise that her talk also revolved around that. She delineates an experience from her life when she was forced to raise her voice for herself. She encouraged everyone in the audience to never lose your voice and to always stand your ground.\n\nThe next speaker was the programmer and freethinker, Alok Rajasukumaran. Alok’s talk was without a doubt the most unique of the day as he took the audience through a philosophical adventure through the cosmos, the universe and existentialism. After a short break, we resumed with the exuberant Ambika Bhardwaj, Traveller and Writer. Better known to her fans as Dastaan e Musafir, she detailed her experiences travelling from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and taught the audience how they can also do the same for almost free. Closing off the talks for the days was the amazing Job Kurian, playback singer and music composer. Job talked about his life and experiences in the music industry and the changes brought on by following his passion.\n\nUnlike most other TEDx events, TEDxMBCET also had a star studded cast of talented performers. The first performance of the day was by a group of students from MBCET. Sraavan Krishnakumar and Achuyth Ramesh, violinists joined by Ryan Issac, pianist performed instrumental renditions of various pop songs as the audience sat thrilled and mesmerised. The next performer was the indie alternative rock band, Adholokam. They performed covers of popular malayalam songs and even some of their originals like ‘Pakshi’.\n\nJob Kurian again makes an appearance on stage, but this time with a persona he has donned many times before. He performed many songs from his repertoire and each song ended with his audience asking for more.\n\nTEDxMBCET started out as a small idea that grew into a possibility that flourished itself into a reality. A reality that was successful, inspiring, entertaining and motivating\n\nINGRESS HACKATHON\n\n### Vision\n\nTo be a Centre of Excellence in Computer Science and Engineering providing quality education and research for the betterment of the society.",
